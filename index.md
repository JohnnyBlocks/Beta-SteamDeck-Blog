# JB's Steam Deck Cookbook

## Introduction

I've been tired of the poor content or video content on '**How To Do**' things on the [Steam Deck.](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck)

This is my collection of resources.  Hopefully this will help someone.
I will add content as I add content to my deck.  If the item is not a link it means it is a place holder for my draft ideas that have not yet been fully fleshed out or not yet written.
