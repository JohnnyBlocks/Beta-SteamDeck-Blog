I got my steam deck.   Did some stuff.  It's great.

There's a lot of bad guides and 'How Tos' out there.  A lot of video content, which I do not care for.  I want to copy/paste and read, not listen.

So I started a document to help share processes that will work for everyone to enhance their deck experience.

I used GitHub Pages to host a site.   It's automation allows you to pick from a couple templates.  But I wanted more cusomization and features.   This required learning Jekyll.    Seems like the ideal is to create a repo with a full jekyll site and deploy it via Pages.

I'm on Windows 11.   Well let's get Jekyll installed.

Okay... WLS.. Ubuntu in windows.  Great!

install Jekll.  Ruby error: bigdecimal ERROR: While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError) You don't have write permissions for the /var/lib/gems/2.5.0 directory.

Uninstall / Reinstall Ruby.  Still fail.

Ruby is totally uninstalled now.

https://github.com/rvm/ubuntu_rvm

sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:rael-gc/rvm
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rvm

Reboot - but via windows cmd shell.  Super dope!


   33  rvm install ruby
   34  rvm install ruby2.5-dev build-essential dh-autoreconf
   35  gem update


Winning!  Finally got the gem command to work.

gem install jekyll bundler
jekyll -v

jekyll 4.2.2

Okay... So now it's all working locally... Let's use that to generate a new project that I'll massage into my steam deck project once I have to structures and configs generated.
